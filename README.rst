Introduction
============

This repo is part of the tutorial found in
https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_conda_recipes.git

It contains a single C++ library, ``ags_blosc_wrapper``, that
is a dumb wrapper around the popular ``c-blosc`` compression
library (https://github.com/Blosc/c-blosc).

The purpose is to demonstrate several techniques:

- How to manage external dependencies using ``conda``
  and build using ``cmake``

- How to build both static and dynamic binaries

- How to expose both a C++ and C API using
  the *opaque pointer* technique

The purpose of the C API (which is a wrapper around
the C++ code) is to allow other languages to bind
to this library easily.

In turn, this project serves as a dependency for 
two other projects:

- https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_example_py_wrapper.git
  (a python wrapper around this library)

- https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_example_cpp_app.git
  (a C++ application that builds against this library)


How to build
============

The ``conda`` build recipe is located in 
https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_conda_recipes.git
You can use it to build and publish the library as a tarball.
It can then be installed in the usual ``conda`` way::

    conda install ags_example_cpp_lib

However, you can also build and install this project by hand.
Assuming that ``c-blosc`` is installed in the following location::

    /some/path/include/blosc.h
    /some/path/lib/libblosc.so

you can build and install with the following commands::

    git clone https://github.com/ActivisionGameScience/ags_example_cpp_lib.git
    cd ags_example_cpp_lib
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../ -DCBLOSC_ROOT=/some/path -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path
    make
    make install

You will now have the following files installed::

    /some/path/include/activision_game_science/*.h
    /some/path/lib/libags_blosc_wrapper.so
    /some/path/lib/libags_blosc_wrapper_static.a
